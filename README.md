Exploration of Oracle Functions using AsterionDB

# Overview
The intention for this project is to create examples of integration of AsterionDB installed in an Oralce Cloud
Database (such as Autonomous - Free Tier) with the Oracle Cloud services around Oracle Fn.  Initially, a goal is
to compare solutions which might involved Secure Objects in it's work flow with that of content residing or
arriving into AsterionDB.

These comparisons might be extended to see how it might be implpemented a competing cloud (such as Serverless on
AWS) as well as against a pure AsterionDB platform implemenation.

Important metrics include performance as well as cost, this can also serve as starting points for Tutorials on how
to bring the two technologies together.
